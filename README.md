# Spring Cloud Stream Microservices Communications
Spring Cloud Stream, interconnecting microservices.

Spring Cloud Stream makes it very easy for developers to create Java applications that communicate through message brokers such as Kafka and RabbitMQ.

Spring Cloud Stream allows us to do this by minimizing boilerplate and maximizing the utility of the Spring Framework, so you can focus on implementing your business logic. 

Spring Cloud Stream provide defaults for pretty much everything, such as connecting to the broker, declaring inbound/outbound topics, and serializing/deserializing data.
